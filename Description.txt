This project was to replicate a hot potato game with LEDs and pushbuttons.  This was programmed in Arduino using three
Adafruit METRO M0 Express microcontrollers.  Players have a left and right push button to transfer the "hot potato."
The 'hot potato' is represented as the LED that is currently turned on. The game begins with pressing the start push button
which lights one of three players at random.  The time of game is set at random every game with a minimum of 20 seconds.
The game ends when the current LED lit is blinking which in turn disables all players push buttons.
